Angular 101

Raphael Essoo-Snowdon & Rob Crocombe

* A few things to note

- assumes you have the Dashboard Service running locally
- sidestep some best practices

* Some tips

- always branch off of `staging`
- always run `npm i` just in case new node packages have been added
- run `gulp` to run/serve the dashboard locally
- Gulp uses live reload but it doesn't pick up new files that have been added since running `gulp`, restart Gulp to fix this
- `constants.ts` file is where you can update where your environment is pointing

* Demo

* Pre-existing components

- try and use components that exist already in the dashboard
- `/patterns` has a collection of components that you can use
- not everything is documented here, but more often than not, most UI elements thast exist in the dashboard today are components

* Next time (if there's any interest)

- bindings and communicating between components
- nested components
- transclusion
- smart vs. dumb components
- Services, Filters, Directives

* Demo code

- repo can be found here ([[https://github.com/unravelin/dashboard-service/tree/angular-101]])
- this branch is for demo purposes only, please don't branch off of this branch
